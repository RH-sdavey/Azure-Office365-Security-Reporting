## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- PowerShell 7.0 or higher
- Access to Azure/Office 365 tenant for testing
- Git for version control
- VSCode (recommended for development)

### Development Setup
1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Azure-Office365-Security-Reporting.git
   cd Azure-Office365-Security-Reporting
   ```

2. **Set up your development environment**
   ```powershell
   # Install required modules
   .\AzureSecurityReport-Modular.ps1
   # Follow prompts to install dependencies
   ```

3. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## üìù Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use **Pascal Case** for function names: `Get-SecurityReport`
- Use **Camel Case** for variables: `$userCount`
- Include **comprehensive comments** for complex logic
- Follow **PowerShell best practices** and coding standards
- Use **approved PowerShell verbs** where possible

### Module Structure
```powershell
# Each function should include:
function Get-ExampleReport {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Brief description of the function
    .DESCRIPTION
        Detailed description of what the function does
    .EXAMPLE
        Get-ExampleReport
        Example of how to use the function
    #>
    
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$false)]
        [string]$ExampleParameter
    )
    
    try {
        Write-ColorOutput "Starting example report..." "Yellow"
        
        # Function logic here
        
        Write-ColorOutput "‚úì Example report completed successfully." "Green"
    } catch {
        Write-ColorOutput "Error in example report: $($_.Exception.Message)" "Red"
        Write-Log "Error in example report: $($_.Exception.Message)" "ERROR"
    }
}
```

### Error Handling
- Always use **try-catch blocks** for external API calls
- Log errors using the **Write-Log function**
- Provide **user-friendly error messages**
- Include **actionable recommendations** where possible

### Testing
- Test your changes with **different tenant configurations**
- Verify **read-only operations** - ensure no modifications are made
- Test **error scenarios** and edge cases
- Validate **CSV export functionality**

## üìä Adding New Security Checks

### Guidelines for New Checks
1. **Research the security requirement** thoroughly
2. **Identify the appropriate PowerShell module** and cmdlets
3. **Determine required permissions** and scopes
4. **Design the check logic** to be read-only
5. **Create meaningful output** with clear recommendations
6. **Add export functionality** for findings
7. **Include comprehensive error handling**

### Example: Adding a New Office 365 Check
```powershell
# Function to check SharePoint external sharing settings
function Get-SharePointExternalSharingReport {
    Write-ColorOutput "Checking SharePoint external sharing settings..." "Yellow"
    
    try {
        # Check if SharePoint module is available
        if (-not (Get-Module -ListAvailable -Name "Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell")) {
            Write-ColorOutput "SharePoint Online Management Shell is required. Please install it." "Red"
            return
        }
        
        # Your implementation here
        
        # Display summary with color coding
        if ($hasSecurityIssues) {
            Write-ColorOutput "‚ö† External sharing risks detected!" "Red"
        } else {
            Write-ColorOutput "‚úì SharePoint external sharing properly configured." "Green"
        }
        
        # Prompt for export
        $Export = Read-Host "Would you like to export SharePoint sharing settings to CSV? (Y/N)"
        if ($Export -eq 'Y' -or $Export -eq 'y') {
            $FilePath = Get-ValidFilePath "SharePoint_External_Sharing_Report"
            $Report | Export-Csv -Path $FilePath -NoTypeInformation -ErrorAction Stop
            Write-ColorOutput "Results exported to: $FilePath" "Green"
        }
        
    } catch {
        Write-ColorOutput "Error checking SharePoint external sharing: $($_.Exception.Message)" "Red"
        Write-Log "Error checking SharePoint external sharing: $($_.Exception.Message)" "ERROR"
    }
}
```
