### 🛡️ New Security Reporting Modules
| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Azure Storage Security** | Detects public blob containers, validates encryption, checks HTTPS enforcement, and analyzes network access rules. |
| **Azure Key Vault Security** | Monitors certificate expiration, analyzes access policies, validates network restrictions, and checks soft delete/purge protection. |
| **Network Security Groups (NSG)** | Identifies dangerous firewall rules, internet-exposed services, SSH/RDP exposure, and database port security. |
| **SharePoint & OneDrive Security** | Analyzes external sharing, OneDrive usage, Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies, and guest access. |
| **Configuration Management** | Supports encrypted credential storage, auto-connect, customizable export paths, and configuration backup/restore. |

### 📈 Enhanced Reporting
- 5 new timestamped CSV reports.
- Risk-based scoring (Critical/High/Medium/Low).
- Security recommendations for each finding.
- Executive summary dashboards.

## 🚀 Quick Start

---
### Prerequisites

Ensure you have PowerShell 7.0+ installed:
```powershell
# Check PowerShell version
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SteffMet/Azure-Office365-Security-Reporting.git
   cd Azure-Office365-Security-Reporting
   ```

2. **Run the launcher script (Recommended):**
   ```powershell
   .\Start-AzureSecurityReport.ps1
   ```
   
   **Or run directly:**
   ```powershell
   # Modular version (recommended)
   .\AzureSecurityReport-Modular.ps1
   ```

## 🔑 Required Permissions

### Azure AD Roles
- **Recommended**: Global Reader or Security Reader
- **Minimum**: Directory Readers + specific object permissions

### Azure Subscription Permissions
- **Storage Security**: Storage Account Contributor (read-only)
- **Key Vault Security**: Key Vault Reader
- **Network Security**: Network Contributor (read-only)
- **VM Security**: Virtual Machine Contributor (read-only)

### Microsoft Graph API Permissions
```
User.Read.All
Directory.Read.All
Policy.Read.ConditionalAccess
UserAuthenticationMethod.Read.All
Organization.Read.All
Reports.Read.All
AuditLog.Read.All
Sites.Read.All
```

### Office 365 Permissions
- **Exchange Online**: View-Only Organization Management
- **Microsoft Teams**: Teams Administrator (read-only operations)
- **SharePoint Online**: SharePoint Administrator (read-only operations)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Microsoft Graph Assembly Conflicts
If you encounter "Assembly with same name is already loaded" errors:

**🔧 Quick Fix Options:**

1. **Use the launcher script (Recommended)**:
   ```powershell
   .\Start-AzureSecurityReport.ps1
   ```

2. **Use the fix script**:
   ```powershell
   .\Fix-GraphModules.ps1
   ```

3. **Manual session restart**:
   ```powershell
   # Exit PowerShell completely
   exit
   
   # Start fresh PowerShell 7 session
   pwsh
   cd "path\to\Azure-Office365-Security-Reporting"
   .\AzureSecurityReport-Modular.ps1
   ```

4. **Automatic restart helper**:
   ```powershell
   .\Restart-PowerShellSession.ps1
   ```

**🔍 Why This Happens:**
Microsoft Graph PowerShell modules use .NET assemblies that can conflict when loaded multiple times in the same session. This is a known limitation of the Microsoft Graph SDK.

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Module import errors | Run `Install-Module` as Administrator |
| Authentication failures | Verify account permissions and retry |
| CSV export errors | Check file path permissions |
| Graph API rate limits | Wait and retry after a few minutes |
